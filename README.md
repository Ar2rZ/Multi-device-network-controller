Multi-device-network-controller
===============================

Combine input from many different devices, like Kinect, eyetribe, xbox controller, yei accelerometer, android phone and many others and send the signals across the network or to the local machine using a standardized control interface to make all these devices plug and play for use in games and game engines like unity.

As part of my journey working with virtual reality I see the need to standardize the API set that all these various input devices provide to make development and integration easier.

The goal is to turn the output from devices into the following ommon interface that can be fed across the network to allow a dedicated machine to host the input controllers allowing a secondary machine to be soley responsible for rendering the game or experience or be the mobile display machine.

Note: This repository is almost soley for my use, any code here may contain bugs and may otherwise not follow structuralized testing.  Think of it as a playground and a great place to maybe find some code that will allow you to use things like a Kinect on one computer, and an Oculus rift hooked up to a laptop on another computer (laptop/Surface).
